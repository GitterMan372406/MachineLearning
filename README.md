# MachineLearning
A simple repository dedicated to making machine learning easier. (Very simple, could use some help)
I'm a (very) casual programmer interested in machine learning. This repo is dedicated to easing the process of building a machine learning algo.
So far, only a simple 4-input perceptron has been made, commits to extend it to customisable step funcs and higher input compatibility would be greatly appreciated.

PS. I'm new to Git
